# 1. Prove that PCP is undecidable by reduction from $A_{TM}$
 - using contradiction to say $PCP$ is decidable.
construct a computable  function $f$ which on input returns the set of pieces
```python
def f(<m,w>):
	p = set() #set of pices that we can play with.
	if M accepts W:
		return matching set()
	else:
		return nonmatching set()
```
This is wrong because we dont know how **$M$ accepts $W$**

I will have to create my steps
```python
def f(<(Q,SUM,F,m,omega),w>):
	p = set([hashtag/hashtag]) #set of pices that we can play with.
	p.insert([hashtag/hashtag+p0+w+hashtag])
	for t in (q,a,b,q`R)
		p.insert([qa/qb])
	for (q,a,b,q´,L) in delta
	return p
```

$<m,w> \in A_{TM}$ if $P \in PCP$ 
$M$ accepts $W$ if $P$ has a match

# We have 3 steps
1. describe function with the pseudo code input and output 
2. show the function you have provide for the pseudo code is compatible and does not loop forever.
3. prove that $W\in A$ if $F(w)\in B$.




T(N,<) → T(N,+)
```python
def f(Formula.Contaion(<))


return Formula.contain(+)
```
