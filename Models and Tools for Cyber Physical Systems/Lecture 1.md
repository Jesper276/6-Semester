# [[Input-Enabled Components]]
- All the components we have seen so far have the following property: in every state and for every input, the component has at least one reaction.
# [[Task Graphs and Await Dependencies]]
- Each task has an associated read-set R and write-set W of variables.
	- It assigns values to variables in the write-set given the values of variables in the read set
